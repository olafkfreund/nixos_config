## 2025-01-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Infrastructure Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Establish NixOS Infrastructure Hub as a comprehensive, sophisticated private NixOS configuration management system targeting infrastructure owners who need advanced automation, monitoring, AI integration, and development environments with declarative, reproducible configurations.

### Context

The infrastructure has evolved from a simple NixOS configuration to a sophisticated multi-host system with 141+ modules, advanced monitoring, AI integration, and comprehensive automation. The system serves both as production infrastructure and a showcase of advanced NixOS patterns for the community.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Configuration Management (Ansible/Puppet)**
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, widespread adoption, extensive documentation
   - Cons: Mutable state, configuration drift, complex dependency management

2. **Simple NixOS Configurations**
   - Pros: Simpler maintenance, less complexity, faster builds
   - Cons: Limited reusability, no advanced features, manual processes

3. **Container-Only Infrastructure**
   - Pros: Platform agnostic, easier migration, established patterns
   - Cons: Less system integration, security concerns, resource overhead

### Rationale

NixOS provides the ideal foundation for declarative infrastructure with immutable configurations, atomic updates, and reproducible builds. The modular architecture enables sophisticated feature management while maintaining simplicity through feature flags. The comprehensive monitoring and AI integration provide competitive advantages in infrastructure management.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Declarative infrastructure with zero configuration drift
- Reproducible environments across all hosts
- Advanced monitoring and observability capabilities
- AI-powered optimization and automation
- Modular architecture enabling selective feature deployment
- Comprehensive automation reducing operational overhead

**Negative:**
- Steep learning curve for NixOS-specific patterns
- Complex build times for large configuration changes
- Limited ecosystem compared to traditional tools
- Requires deep understanding of Nix language
- Potential over-engineering for simple use cases

## 2025-01-29: Modular Architecture with Feature Flags

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Infrastructure Owner, NixOS Community

### Decision

Implement a sophisticated 141+ module system with feature flags, dependency validation, and conditional loading to provide maximum flexibility while maintaining configuration safety and performance.

### Context

Managing multiple hosts with different hardware profiles, service requirements, and resource constraints requires a flexible module system that can adapt to various deployment scenarios without code duplication.

### Rationale

Feature flags enable selective module deployment based on host capabilities and requirements, reducing resource usage and build times. Dependency validation prevents configuration conflicts, while conditional loading optimizes evaluation performance.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent configuration patterns across all modules
- Reduced resource usage through selective feature deployment
- Prevention of configuration conflicts through validation
- Easier maintenance and testing of individual components

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in module development
- Learning curve for understanding feature dependencies
- Potential performance overhead in validation logic

## 2025-01-29: AI Provider Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Infrastructure Owner

### Decision

Integrate multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) with a unified client interface to enable intelligent infrastructure management, optimization suggestions, and automated troubleshooting.

### Context

Modern infrastructure benefits from AI-powered insights for optimization, predictive maintenance, and automated decision-making. Multiple providers ensure redundancy and access to different AI capabilities.

### Rationale

Unified interface prevents vendor lock-in while enabling experimentation with different AI models. Local Ollama deployment ensures functionality during network outages. AI integration provides competitive advantages in infrastructure optimization.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Intelligent infrastructure optimization and suggestions
- Reduced operational overhead through automation
- Future-proofing with multiple AI provider support
- Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in configuration management
- Potential security concerns with API key management
- Resource usage for local AI model deployment
- Learning curve for AI-powered workflows

## 2025-01-29: Comprehensive Monitoring Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Infrastructure Owner

### Decision

Deploy full Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack with custom exporters, performance analytics, and multi-host dashboards to enable proactive infrastructure management and optimization.

### Context

Infrastructure reliability requires comprehensive monitoring and observability. Traditional home lab setups often lack enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities, leading to reactive rather than proactive management.

### Rationale

Prometheus/Grafana provides enterprise-grade monitoring with excellent NixOS integration. Custom exporters enable monitoring of NixOS-specific metrics. Multi-host dashboards provide centralized visibility across all infrastructure components.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Proactive identification of performance issues and resource constraints
- Historical data for capacity planning and optimization
- Automated alerting for critical infrastructure problems
- Performance baselines for measuring optimization effectiveness

**Negative:**
- Additional resource usage for monitoring infrastructure
- Complexity in configuring and maintaining monitoring stack
- Learning curve for Prometheus/Grafana administration
- Storage requirements for metrics and logs

## 2025-01-29: Live USB Installer Strategy

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Infrastructure Owner

### Decision

Create hardware-specific live USB installer images with automated setup wizards to enable rapid deployment and recovery of NixOS hosts with proper configuration integration.

### Context

Infrastructure deployment and disaster recovery requires reliable, automated installation processes. Traditional NixOS installation can be complex and error-prone for sophisticated configurations.

### Rationale

Hardware-specific installers ensure optimal configuration for each host type. Automated wizards reduce human error and deployment time. Integration with existing configuration management enables consistent deployments.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid deployment and recovery capabilities
- Reduced human error in installation processes
- Consistent configuration deployment across hosts
- Enhanced disaster recovery preparedness

**Negative:**
- Additional maintenance overhead for installer images
- Storage requirements for multiple installer variants
- Complexity in maintaining hardware-specific configurations
- Potential security concerns with automated installation
