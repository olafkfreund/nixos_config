# üóÇÔ∏è Project Plan: NixOS Modular Configuration

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

- Modular, flake-based NixOS configuration established
- Multi-host support with per-host directories and variables
- Home Manager integration for user environments
- Custom overlays and package definitions in `pkgs/`
- Gruvbox-based themes and wallpapers in `themes/`
- Modular system and user configuration in `modules/` and `home/`
- Utility scripts for system management in `scripts/`
- Host-specific optimizations for P620, Razer, P510, and DEX5550
- Documentation and onboarding instructions in `README.md`
- Adherence to Nixpkgs and Home Manager best practices

## üöß What Needs To Be Done

- [ ] **Secrets Management:** Integrate SOPS or Agenix for secure, declarative secrets management
- [ ] **Automated Testing:** Add CI for configuration validation and build checks
- [ ] **Improve Documentation:** Expand module-level docs and add usage examples
- [ ] **Module Coverage:** Add more modules for common services (e.g., printing, scanning, backup)
- [ ] **Hardware Profiles:** Refine and document hardware-specific optimizations
- [ ] **Performance Tuning:** Review and optimize build and runtime performance
- [ ] **Security Hardening:** Audit and improve security settings, enable service isolation
- [ ] **User Experience:** Add more themes, desktop environments, and user-level options
- [ ] **Community Standards:** Ensure all code follows contribution guidelines and is well-commented
- [ ] **Versioning:** Add CHANGELOG.md and tag stable releases
- [ ] **Resource Management:** Automate garbage collection and resource cleanup
- [ ] **Integration:** Test with latest NixOS and Home Manager versions, document upgrade paths

**Goal:** Make this the most maintainable, secure, and user-friendly NixOS configuration repository, with reproducible builds, strong documentation, and robust secrets management.
