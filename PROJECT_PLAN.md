## üîê Secrets Management Implementation

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Core Infrastructure

- **Agenix Integration**: Full integration with age encryption for declarative secrets
- **Multi-Host Key Management**: Host-specific SSH keys with proper access control
- **Multi-User Support**: Individual user secrets with role-based access patterns
- **Service Secrets**: Secure management of service credentials (Docker, databases, APIs)
- **Management Scripts**: User-friendly CLI tools for secret operations and recovery

#### Security Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: All secrets encrypted at rest with age encryption
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles and host requirements
- **Key Rotation**: Support for key rotation and secret rekeying
- **Audit Trail**: All secret access logged through systemd
- **Recovery Tools**: Scripts for handling key mismatches and secret recovery

#### User Experience

- **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use management scripts for all secret operations
- **Key Extraction**: Automated SSH key discovery and configuration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery guidance
- **Documentation**: Complete usage examples and troubleshooting guides

### üìã Secrets Management Usage

#### Initial Setup

```bash
# Initialize secrets management system
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh init

# Extract SSH keys for configuration
./scripts/get-keys.sh

# Update secrets.nix with actual public keys
nano secrets.nix

# Apply configuration changes
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>
```

#### Daily Operations

```bash
# Create new secrets
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh create user-password-newuser
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh create api-key-github

# Edit existing secrets
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh edit user-password-olafkfreund

# List all available secrets
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh list

# Check system status
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh status
```

#### Key Management

```bash
# Rekey all secrets after key changes
./scripts/manage-secrets.sh rekey

# Recover from key mismatches
./scripts/recover-secrets.sh

# Extract keys from current system
./scripts/get-keys.sh
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Host Configuration Pattern

Each host follows a standardized structure with hardware-specific optimizations:

- **P620 Workstation**: AMD-focused with ROCm support for GPU computing
- **Razer Laptop**: Intel/NVIDIA hybrid graphics with power management
- **P510 Workstation**: Intel Xeon with NVIDIA CUDA support
- **DEX5550 SFF**: Intel integrated graphics with efficiency optimizations

### Multi-User Architecture

- **Dynamic User Creation**: Users defined per-host with automatic system integration
- **Role-Based Access**: Secrets and services configured based on user roles
- **Shared Configurations**: Common settings applied across all users
- **Individual Customization**: Per-user Home Manager configurations

### Security Architecture

- **Declarative Secrets**: All sensitive data managed through Agenix
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and services have minimal required access
- **Host Isolation**: Secrets scoped to relevant hosts and users
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all secret access
