# DevShell Patch Issue Resolution

## Issue Description

A build failure occurred in the devenv package due to a failing security patch for Nix 2.24:

```
error: could not download 'ghsa-g948-229j-48j3-2.24.patch'
```

This patch failure prevents any NixOS configuration with `devshell = true` from building successfully.

## Resolution

**Temporary Fix Applied (2025-06-26):**

- Disabled `devshell = true` on all affected hosts:
  - `hosts/p620/configuration.nix`
  - `hosts/p510/configuration.nix`
  - `hosts/razer/configuration.nix`
  - `hosts/dex5550/configuration.nix`

**Changed from:**

```nix
devshell = true;
```

**Changed to:**

```nix
devshell = false; # Temporarily disabled due to patch issue
```

## Impact

- **What still works:** All other development tools and features remain functional
- **What's temporarily unavailable:** devenv development environments
- **Gemini CLI:** Fully functional and integrated across all hosts

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor upstream:** Watch for devenv package fixes in nixpkgs
2. **Re-enable when fixed:** Change `devshell = false` back to `devshell = true` once the patch issue is resolved
3. **Alternative:** Consider switching to direnv + flakes for development environments if devenv continues to have issues

## Status Verification

✅ Flake check passes: `nix flake check`
✅ Gemini CLI builds: `nix build .#gemini-cli`
✅ NixOS configurations build: All hosts can be built successfully
✅ Gemini CLI functional: `./result/bin/gemini --help` works correctly

## Commit Reference

Fixed in commit: `7240c5952` - "fix: temporarily disable devshell on all hosts due to Nix 2.24 patch issue"

---

**Note:** This is a temporary workaround. The devshell feature will be re-enabled once the upstream devenv package is fixed.
